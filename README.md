# Welcome to the OSX 4000 R sessions!

Here you will find all the teaching material for the R components of the OSX 4000 Marine ecology skills module. This module is for students on the Bangor University Marine Environmental Protection and Marine Biology Masters programmes. The R sessions are designed to meet the growing expectation for scientists to conduct

## Session content

These R sessions are designed for complete beginners, with no previous experience in programming. We will cover 

## Learning outcomes

1. Develop proficiency in the programming language R
2. Use R to manipulate datasets
3. Use R to explore and visualize data
4. Use R to apply univariate statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, regression, lm)

## How to get in touch

Blackboard is the preferred way of communication and ***THE*** best way to get your questions on these R sessions answered, so please visit the Blackboard discussion board for this module. If you need to use email, send general course related questions to a.heenan@bangor.ac.uk Any general IT issues sent via a [Bangor University Helpdesk ticket] (https://www.bangor.ac.uk/itservices/getting-help.php.en).

*Note: These R sessions of the OSX4000 Marine Ecology Skills module are based on a combination of voluntary, open source contributions made to [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org) as well as an open source course published by Johnston et al. (2019) [^Johnson_2019]. The Johnston et al. (2019) course content forms the backbone of the R teaching materials outlined here, with modifications made based on Bangor University lecturer Jenny Shepperson's work on the undergraduate environmental data analysis course, and adaptions to meet the aims of OSX 4000 Marine Ecology Skills module.
